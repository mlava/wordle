Yes, that's right. Wordle in your Roam Research graph.

You can trigger this extension from the Command Palette using 'Play Wordle'.

This extension pulls the NYT word of the day and you can play Wordle right in your graph. 

Just like the official website, you will be warned if you enter two few letters or a word that doesn't exist. Correct letters will be coloured green and misplaced letters yellow.

You get six tries or you fail. Good luck!
